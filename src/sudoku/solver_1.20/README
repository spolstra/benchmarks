To build the sudoku_solver binary on your Linux workstation, simple run 'make'.
If your into performance optimization, edit the Makefile and change the
processor option PROC_OPT from '-march=i686' to whatever better suits
your processor architecture. Check the GCC docs for details. Also, by omitting
the option -DEXPLAIN from the compile time options, (and thereby eliminating
the -e or explain option) you will gain a speed improvement of roughly 6%.

For more documentation on how to run the program, see the source code
(No really, there is a write-up in the initial comment block! ;-) or 
run the program with the -? option.
