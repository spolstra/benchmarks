This directory contains a modified version of the classical
'dhrystone' benchmark.

This version was modified as follows:

- function declarations were introduced to silence warnings in modern
  C compilers.
- a new way to measure time with gettimeofday() was introduced,
  activated with -DGTIMEOD.


NB: The Makefile invokes `slc' with -DMG_VIRTUAL_TIME, so that when
    run in MGSim the time is computing relative to the simulation, not
    to the wall clock. This avoids benchmarking differences when
    running MGSim on different systems where MGSim itself would run at
    different speeds.
